# What number's bigger?

Write a function named greaterNum that:
takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").
