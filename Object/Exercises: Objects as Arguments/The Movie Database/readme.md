The Movie Database
It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!

Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).
Create a function to print out the movie information like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."
